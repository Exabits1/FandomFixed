# FandomFixed
Adblock/uBlock Origin filter to remove all annoyances for Fandom.com wikis. Hides the sidebar, comments, related posts, unrelated links, and more. Works best with uBO on Firefox.
The sidebars are all removed, with the article taking up more space.

# This filter is primarily for readers!
This removes a ton of features that the general public who just wants to read articles doesn't need comments, editing, related articles, Wikia news, and more. I don't know how well this works for editing. Please report any bugs when editing or moderating.

# Disabled "features"
Comments, social media share links, discussion topics, posting, Discord invitation popups (on certain wikis), suggested Wikis, partnered wikis, the righthand side popular pages and images, the bottom random articles, the left hand sidebar, the bottom TikTok popups, videos, and more.
